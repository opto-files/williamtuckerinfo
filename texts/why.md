Why Am I Learning Maths and Haskell? (And Not Learning to Draw)
====================================

At 18 I decided to study Music Technology at University. Making music was what I lived for - one summer my teacher let me take home an audio interface and I spent 6 weeks making demo's of the little songs I'd write. By the time I was leaving for Uni I had moved on to making dance music and loved every moment I spent learning how to make music that *sounded* like the tunes I liked. That was the appeal for me, whether I could make a bass sound like *that*, make drums sound that full... I couldn't wait to spend my time at University getting better at crafting sounds - who cares whether it ever pays me! That's what I did, and I still think I made a great decision.

What I ignored when I chose to go and study Music was a childhood where I was constantly told that my strong suit was maths. I felt like I **got** maths, and I enjoyed it a lot for a long time. Looking back it was probably the first thing I knew in myself I was good at (no small thing). My teachers recognized it and encouraged me - another kid in my class and I were sent off to the local University on saturdays for a while, studying subjects beyond what we were going to get to in the school's syllabus - joined by about 60 or so kids from schools around the area.

"All set up then", said my teachers, "to study Maths at University and get a good job". 

I don't think I ever even entertained the idea. During A-Levels I completely lost touch with Maths. It had stopped being about an instinctual sense of 'how quickly can you work this out', and turned into plugging numbers through methods. Why are we plugging these numbers through these methods? For points on the exam. At least that's how it felt to me. I felt no particular inspiration for integration, and now that I am writing this, I couldn't even tell you what kind of problems integration helps you solve. The same went for all of the topics we covered. So no, I went and studied Music because it was what I loved. 

What now, a few years out of Uni, when you don't love it any more?

Since I became disillusioned with music I have told myself I am going to be every other kind of artist there is. Painter, writer, sculptor...or I could really commit to classical drawing... And for a short while I tried to. For those of you who know what they are, I'd even begun doing the Bargue Plates, and own a good few books about the serious study of drawing. But my heart was never really in it - I have never drawn in my life and have (I've come to find out) very shaky hands. 

Who am I kidding? I felt naturally good at Music, I had a feeling for it, but it no longer appeals to me. I can't just stop having something to work on, not when pursuing art felt like the impetus of my adult life up until this point. So I have decided to go back to my first skill - that first thing I felt good at - Maths. 

### But why Haskell?

I have been hacking away at programming for a little over 3 years now. I first got into it because a picture I liked said it had been made with a Pixel-Sorting algorithm in [Processing](https://processing.org), which you could download and run yourself on your own pictures. Perfect! So I downloaded it, opened it all up - and had no clue what I was looking at. Since then I guess I have been trying to have more and more of a clue what I am looking at. I learned enough Python to do what I did in Processing but it being readable to me - and learned the web framework for Processing, [p5JS](https://p5js.org). 

Then I saw the work of Anders Hoff, who goes by [Inconvergent](https://inconvergent.net/2017/snek-is-not-an-acronym) He had implemented this general system for working with vectors for making images in Lisp, and I found the whole thing very interesting. So my most recent programming experience has been trying to hack together something similar in Scheme, which I never got very far with because I was trying to get it all to interface with my pen plotter from the 80s.

However, though the project never really got off the ground, I *loved* Scheme. Well, I still do. I worked my way through the legendary MIT course [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/) and felt as if I had finally got a grip on what I was seeing when I looked at code. However I felt very aware of the fact that I was using a language where the community is absolutely amazing, but spread over god knows how many permutations of Scheme itself. 

Now that I am trying to take studying Maths seriously, I figure I should get serious about programming as well, and ever since I first heard about Haskell I wanted to try it. Writing 'functionally' (whatever this word means) in Scheme had helped me reason better about my programs, and Haskell's type system seems like a great tool (and I'm sure soon I will understand it to be more than this) to further that ability to clearly understand be able to reason about what you are writing. Add to that a great community, [Stack](https://haskellstack.org) and [Intero](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero) - as far as I can see I have an experience which is (almost) as closely integrated as developing in Lisp/Scheme with this beautifully interesting language.
