About

Hello!

I am William Tucker and I maintain this blog as a means of documenting my experience studying Math and Haskell as an amateur enthusiast. Hopefully others who are pursuing an interest in maths or programming as a hobbyist (there *must* be many, many more of us than there are people being paid to do this stuff) will find something of value here, as well as it providing a place for me to communicate and consolidate what I have learned along the way.

It is my hope that people reading these blogs will get in touch with me - to point out where I've gone wrong, suggest where I might find a new avenue of exploration, or even just to say that they are struggling with the same problems I am. It can be difficult to maintain interest in a subject when you are trawling through online courses or toiling through book exercises on your own, so let's check in with each other and help ourselves get towards our goals! Drop me a message at [me@williamtucker.info](mailto:me@williamtucker.info) or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tukr_)!
